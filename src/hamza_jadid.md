## Experience

> **PROXIMIE** _SEPTEMBER 2021 - SEPTEMBER 2022_
>
>> At Proximie I mostly worked with real-time communication using WebRTC, WebSockets,
>> SocketIO, and MQTT. Mentored mobile and quality engineers.
>> Create native libraries written in Rust for our networking and compression subsystems using
>> tokio async runtime and ported the libraries on iOS, Android, IoT devices,
>> and Web (using Web Assembly).
>>
>>
>> **SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER**
>>
>>>
>>> Led the development of PxLens, a resource-constrained device with a camera, and added the
>>> ability to stream audio and video in real-time, made it remotely controllable over the internet,
>>> it also uses the native Rust libraries I have developed.
>>> Currently I'm leading the development of our iOS application which has the content management side
>>> and the real-time audio/video stream side. Moreover, I work with Rust to maintain our networking
>>> library.
>>> I've mentored quality engineers to build a device farm that facilitated our end-to-end testing and
>>> decreased our infrastructural costs.
>>>
>> **MID IOS ENGINEER**
>>
>>> During this time I worked with SwiftUI in its early stages, and most of the features were not
>>> available and I had to write them using UIKit and bridge it to SwiftUI. We've worked with MVVM
>>> pattern.
>>> I've also built the app infrastructure in terms of deployment using Fastlane, crash reporting
>>> using Firebase crashylitics, tracing, and force update.
